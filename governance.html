      <h1>Governance that activates with real participation</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        Kryptho is designed to decentralize in a measurable way. Governance is not declared for appearance. It activates after a minimum base of qualifying holders exists and it enforces transparent constraints around stewardship.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Activation threshold</h2>
      <p>
        Governance activates once at least twenty qualifying holders are identified on chain. A qualifying holder is defined as an address holding more than five million KRYP. Upon activation, metadata update authority will be permanently renounced and the treasury wallet address will be publicly disclosed.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Treasury vesting</h2>
      <p>
        Eighty five percent of total supply is held in a treasury wallet under a time based vesting schedule. Vesting begins on April first two thousand twenty six and releases tokens every two weeks over twenty four months. The purpose is to prevent abrupt supply shocks while enabling long term development under transparent rules.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Allocation logic</h2>
      <p>
        Each vesting release is designed to support liquidity incentives, ecosystem contribution, and disciplined liquidity formation. A portion may be strategically converted to USDC solely to reinforce liquidity depth, with transparent limits and community oversight after governance activation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Conversion cap</h2>
      <p>
        No more than eight percent of total supply may be converted for liquidity purposes within any twelve month period unless governance approves a supermajority exception once governance is active. Conversions are intended to be executed in a manner designed to minimize market disruption.
